1a .Implement a python program to search an element using linear search. 
def linear_search(alist, key): 
    """Return index of key in alist. Return -1 if key not present.""" 
    for i in range(len(alist)): 
        if alist[i] == key: 
            return i 
    return -1  
alist = input('Enter the list of numbers: ') 
alist = alist.split() 
alist = [int(x) for x in alist] 
key = int(input('The number to search for: ')) 
index = linear_search(alist, key) 
if index < 0: 
    print('{} was not found.'.format(key)) 
else: 
    print('{} was found at index {}.'.format(key, index)) 
 
 
b. Implement a python program to search an element using binary search. 
def binary_search(alist, key): 
    """Search key in alist[start... end - 1].""" 
    start = 0 
    end = len(alist) 
    while start < end: 
        mid = (start + end)//2 
        if alist[mid] > key: 
            end = mid 
        elif alist[mid] < key: 
            start = mid + 1 
        else: 
            return mid 
    return -1 
  
  
alist = input('Enter the sorted list of numbers: ') 
alist = alist.split() 
alist = [int(x) for x in alist] 
key = int(input('The number to search for: ')) 
index = binary_search(alist, key) 
if index < 0: 
print('{} was not found.'.format(key)) 
else: 
print('{} was found at index {}.'.format(key, index))
